          I&apos;m Kai Barker, a fourth year student at University of California, Santa Barbara pursuing a B.S in Statistics and Data Science. 
          I have a passion for working with others, solving complex problems, and building tools that make data more accessible and actionable.
          Whether I am in the classroom, working on a personal project, or collaborating on research, I am always looking for new ways to apply my learning.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I enjoy working on projects that blend data analytics, design, and user-focused thinking. I am esepcially interested in roles that involve teamwork and communication.
          Outside of data science, I have worked in multiple sales jobs that have further enhanced my people skills and shown me that I have a passion for helping others and understanding
          their needs. My leadership experience as a store manager has improved my time management skills, and allowed me to learn how to coordinate efforts with a team to 
          meet store goals and customer needs.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In my free time, you can catch me climbing, hiking, or at the pickleball or basketball courts. I am seeking internship opportunities, jobs, or research positions that
          will not only further my technical skills, but that will also challenge me to learn and explore new ideas. Feel free to check out my resume below, and don&apos;t hesitate to reach out, I would love to connect!
